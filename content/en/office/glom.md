[Glom](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glom/) is a high-level database system and user interface designer with a lot of functionality. Its benefits include its simplicity and the fact that it requires almost no programming. It features a separate database server and, while its structure is simple, it's enough to run most database applications. It's loosely based on FileMaker Pro.
