# KOOMPI

[KOOMPI](https://koompi.com/) is a technology development company based in Cambodia that designs and builds solutions-oriented productivity tools for next-generation doers and innovators.

KOOMPI products are designed, assembled, and programmed with customized software developed in Cambodia, while certain key hardware components are outsourced from China due to our present lack of local production facilities.

We do not define KOOMPI as a computer company. Instead, it’s a people-oriented technology and development project that keeps evolving. Though our notebook products are one of our proudest achievements, there is so much more we strive to accomplish. Before we get into the “useful” part of the book, let us take a look at how KOOMPI came to be what it is today and what we are working on.

Chosen as a symbol of knowledge and self-empowerment, the word KOOMPI derives from the Khmer phrase, "books or source of knowledge."

In ancient times, young Cambodian boys would leave home to learn and develop into adulthood at a Buddhist monk monastery. All the books and learning- materials given to these students were simply called KOOMPI. 

Today, students in developing nations struggle to find adequate lesson plans, books, resources, and of growing importance, an internet-enabled notebook for self-directed remote learning.   

Only recently, modern-computer hardware and satellite networks have become advanced and flexible enough for the extreme remote learning conditions of remote Cambodian villages.   

We design KOOMPI to be affordable, lightweight, reliable, and energy-efficient for low-power off-grid systems.

You probably used to wonder: Why would KOOMPI use its own operating system when there are already so many variants of Linux, Microsoft Windows or Apple macOS? Who are the people behind KOOMPI and how did the company materialize into what it is today? Did someone just wake up one day and think “I want to make a computer and I will”? 

KOOMPI didn’t start as a computer brand. It was purely a recycling project. 

It all began at SmallWorld's first old office, KOOMPI’s parent company that deserves a book of itself to tell its story. 

Around the end of 2012, we partnered with recycles.org to gather old computers. Through email groups such as Yahoo Groups and Google Groups, we connected with many organizations and individuals who upgraded their computers and left the older ones unused. We made sure the hardware was still usable and refurbished them. We wiped out the old system that came with it and reloaded it with our own customized Linux based OS. Back then, the OS was called many random names. A few of which, what we can remember, was Meombao (pronounced Meh Ombao) OS or ButterflyOS. 

After a few months of collection, two rooms of our office were full of old computers, both laptops and old CPUs. Not only that we were offered printers, monitors, phones, and all sorts of other electronics appliances. We were only interested in laptops and computers’ parts. So we sorted the ones good enough to be used and were donated to high school students and freshmen.

One problem we had on top of the mountain of old computers was their incompatibility with Linux. At the time it took us three to four (full) days to get one laptop to work because the computers were initially built for Microsoft Windows.

After a year or so, we decided to research how we could make computer hardware along with its very own OS. We didn’t have any academic credentials nor a million dollars.

Only years later, we made it. Though we have come a long way and some things have changed, two things haven’t and those are:

- **Our Mission** is to build tools, provide guidance and resources for the next generation of innovators.
- **Our Vision** is to unlock people's unlimited capacity for self-directed learning by encouraging curiosity, flexibility, and creative imagination.

These two pillars are the Northstar that guides our team in everyday work. They are what keeps our motivation strong and encourages us to contribute to any area of development in any way we can. In the next pages, you will get to know our initiatives and projects.

## Our Initiatives
As a contributor to the open-source community, KOOMPI values the limitless learning unlocked by open source technology and seeks to inspire others to become innovators. We do not identify as a social enterprise but we seek to be a company that actively gives back. We take pride in contributing to the growing educational and technological world. The following are some of our activities. 

- **One-School-One-Lab (OSOL)**
As technology is constantly moving forward, students of all ages need technology skills to be well-equipped before entering university and employment. We believe that functional computer labs are one of the steps toward this goal. OSOL seeks to support schools with the essential resources in implementing an efficient computer education for their students. 

- **One-Student-One-Notebook (OSON)**
Inspired by the original One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program, which began during the late 1990s, we hope to give every child accessibility to technological education, more specifically one computer per student. This project also inspired our second notebook model, the KOOMPI E11, an 11.6-inch notebook that caters to young students’ needs. 

- **KOOMPI Academy (academy.koompi.com)** is a free-access digital platform where students and educators can find or host a variety of self-studying and self-empowerment resources. Lessons are sorted into 5 STEAM subjects: science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics. 

- **Educators/Facilitators**
We assign a minimum of one KOOMPI Educator for every partner school that runs KOOMPI Linux Lab. The role of the Educator is not to “teach” but to facilitate the students’ self-directed learning and communicate any issues to KOOMPI team. The schools are also supported by the KOOMPI to create their ICT curriculum to fit their students’ need.

- **KOOMPI Wi-Fi**
Part of our Internet-For-All campaign, KOOMPI Wi-Fi is a fast fibre or 4G network infrastructure provided by KOOMPI to schools. Students and teachers would only need to pay around or less than 1$ per month per device for unlimited data at between 60 Mbps - 300 Mbps depending on the number of devices connected. We also hope to extend this to remote villages, so their parents and everyone could access the internet as well.

- **KOOMPI Apprenticeship**
KOOMPI Research Lab is open to all individuals who are interested in learning through hands-on experience. We encourage our apprentices to follow their subjects of interest and relevance so that their knowledge will be applicable. For the duration of the apprenticeship, they can contribute to projects at KOOMPI and receive guidance from senior members and staff.
