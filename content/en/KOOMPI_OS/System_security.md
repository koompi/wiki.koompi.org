## System Security


The system itself leverages traditional OS security control to protect user data and system resources, protects device integrity against malware, and provides application isolation – application is separated from the rest of the running processes. 

The robustness and security of the operating system is a result of the following aspects: 

- **Architecture strengths:** structures are appropriated for the environment where it will run.
- **Solid development:** a result of strong developer teams’ knowledge.
- **Fast bug detection:** consists of how quickly flaws and errors are detected. 


#### KOOMPI OS Security Threats
Certain characteristics could compromise security. For example, the OS can be malicious if it is modified to have different behaviour from what was originally intended, making application security mechanisms fail. This only occurs when the users install the integrity of code against a hash signature (official signature). 

Last not least, KOOMPI OS is released under a license where others are allowed to study, change, as well as distribute the software to other people.
