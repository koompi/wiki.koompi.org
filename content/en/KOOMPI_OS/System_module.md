# System Settings Modules

The System Settings organizes modules into **six categories** as described above. Below each category are the following buttons, presented with the options of the module in the main window.

### Help
This button will provide help specific to the current module. Clicking the button will open **KHelpCenter** in a new window providing detailed information on the module.

### Default
Clicking this button will restore this module to its default values. You must click **Apply** to save the options.

### Reset
This button will reset the module to the previous settings. 

### Apply
Clicking this button saves all the changes. If you have changed anything, clicking **Apply** will cause the change to take effect.

### Discard
Use this button if you wish not to save all the changes.

### Cancel
Cancel if you do not want to **Apply** or **Discard**. In short, you will be taken back to where you were. 

***Note:*** *You must either ‘Reset’ or ‘Apply’ the changes before changing to another module. If you try to change without saving or resetting your options, you will be asked if you want to save your changes or discard them.*
