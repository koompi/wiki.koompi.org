***Note:*** *All the modules that make up the System Settings are in the following order to make it easier to locate the correct configuration modules.*

### Location and Starting System Settings
The System Settings is also located in the Applications Menu List. It can be started in three different ways, which are: 
- By searching and selecting **System Settings** in the **Applications Menu List.**
- Pressing **Ctrl + Fn + F2 or Alt + Space.** It will bring up Search Bar, Type **Systemsettings5** and **Enter.**
- Typing **Systemsettings5** in Konsole or command emulator

***Note:*** *All methods mentioned are equivalent, and produce the same result.*


### System Settings Categories
Here is a brief overview of all the categories and modules.

### Appearance 
Though there are only three Global themes normally use, you can still do a lot more to your desktop. You can change your desktop using **plasma styles**, change the appearance of your **settings/tools**, and even the **text display** to any styles, sizes, and colours that is the most suitable for you.

***Note:*** *Using all the dialogues above will overwrite any settings on your Desktop.*    

### Workspace
Desktop environments include extensive support for workspaces, which does not only allow you to organize your open windows onto different desktops but also as tools and features to manage the entire platform for a wide range of users use. 

#### Workspace Behavior
Workspace Behavior is the module that configures the process of usage on the desktop environment. **General Behavior** is the setting that is relevant to common usages like showing notifications of feedback and tooltips, animation speed, the setting of open files, and vertical scrolling. 

**Desktop Effect** is a feature that helps users to configure how to activate the effect on the desktop. Just like every OS, the users can switch screens by using the keyboard, which is **Alt +TAB** on the OS. 

There is a unique feature on the OS called **Screen Edge**, a feature that allows you to set an option in ***eight corners*** to switch the screen. There is also a Screen Touch Setting that is applicable for **touch-screen devices.** 

Another feature is **Screen Locking** which allows users to set time to lock or unlock the screen. The users can also set the appearance of the lock screen.

**Virtual Desktop** is the only setting that allows users to create a new Desktop on the computer. **Activities** is a feature that keeps records of your actions and is also where you can clear the history of those activities.

#### Window Management
If you are looking for more advanced settings for configuring your Workspace Behavior, **Window Management** will be the best option. You can use **Task Switcher** and **KWin scripts** to navigate, minimize and restore, and synchronize screens after switching it.

### Network
#### Connections
This is the setting that controls the connection in the system such as WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) and cellular networks near you. You can also view the details of the WiFi and a history log of all WiFi connections you have used before.

### Hardware
Hardware refers to the physical particles of computers and related devices. Hardware has two types which are internal hardware and external hardware.

- **Internal hardware** includes motherboards, hard drives, and RAM (Random-access memory).
- **External hardware** includes monitors, keyboards, mouses, printers, scanners, and more.

#### Power Management
Aside from reducing energy costs, Power Management involves changing the setting on electronics and optimizing power so that they consume less energy. Its benefits are long battery run times, improved power factor (which enhances active-mode efficiency), and limitation on the app’s access to device resources.
